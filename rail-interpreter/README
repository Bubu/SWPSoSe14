Rail
----

If you are on a windows machine, the program 'rail.exe' is a compiled
version of the interpreter. Just run it without any arguments to get
the usage description. If you want to compile it yourself, open
'rail.sln' with Visual Studio.

If you are on a *nix machine, type 'sh compile.sh' to compile. This
will create a program called 'rail'. Run it to get usage. It is
assumed that you have g++.

There are a number of simple example programs provided which exercise
various parts of the language.

To see a description of the language, go to:

Hope you have fun with this. I certainly did when I made it.
